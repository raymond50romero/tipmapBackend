when creating a new post, i need to add a way so that multiple posts concerning the same restaurant can be linked together. 
I am thinking create a new table that does it and whenever someone puts in an address, a new row is made in this table that 
contains the address as well as a unique identifier and how many links to that restaurant we currently have. also add the 
link to the table to the restaurant post so that if we are looking through posts we know what is the unique identifier
